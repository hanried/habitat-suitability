## **Project Description**
This project analyzes soil, topographic, and climate data to determine whether the Sheyenne and Caddo National Grasslands in the United States will be suitable habitats for the grass species *Sorghastrum nutans* from 2076-2080 depending on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP). The Sheyenne National Grasslands are in the southeastern corner of the state of North Dakota and the Caddo National Grasslands are in the northwestern part of Texas, near the Texas-Oklahoma border.

For the soil data, pH is the analyzed variable. The topographic variable is aspect (degrees) derived from elevation (m), and the climate vairable is precipitation (mm). More specifically for the climate variable, the predicted average annual precipitation (mm) from 2076-2080 is being compared between two different emissions scenarios: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. To look at all three data together, it is assumed that soil pH and aspect will be very similar, if not the same, between current day, 2024, and 2076-2080. So current day soil pH and aspect will be used.

## **Site Descriptions**
### Caddo National Grasslands:
Caddo National Grasslands is mainly in Texas, USA, although a small portion of it is in Oklahoma too. It includes two units: Bois d' Arc Creek Unit (13,360 acres) and Ladonia Unit (2,780 acres)<sup>2</sup> and 3 lakes: Lake Coffee Mill (651 acres), Lake Crockett (388 acres), and Lake Fannin (45 acres)<sup>1</sup>. In the Caddo Grasslands, several recreational activities are available such as camping, picnicking, and fishing.<sup>1</sup> The Caddo is also home to wildlife such as coyotes, waterfowl, turkey, largemouth bass, and sunfish.<sup>1</sup>

### Sheyenne National Grasslands:
According to the US Forest Service Sheyenne National Grasslands website, the Sheyenne National Grasslands are in the southeastern corner of North Dakota, USA and include 70,180 acres of public land amid 64,769 acres of private land. Camping, hiking, hunting, and backpacking are available as well as other recreational activities. This tallgrass prairie is home to prairie chickens, the Dakota skipper (a small butterfly), the Regal Fritillary (another type of butterfly), ferns, and the western prairie fringed orchid.<sup>3</sup>
