# Analysis of Habitat Suitability of the Sheyenne and Caddo National Grasslands for Indiangrass (*Sorghastrum nutans*)
## Project description:
This project analyzes soil, topographic, and climate data to determine whether the Sheyenne and Caddo National Grasslands in the United States are, and will be, suitable habitats for the grass species *Sorghastrum nutans*. The Sheyenne National Grasslands are in the southeastern corner of the state of North Dakota and the Caddo National Grasslands are in the northwestern part of Texas, near the Texas-Oklahoma border.

For the soil data, pH is analyzed. The topographic data is aspect derived from elevation, and the climate data is precipitation. More specifically for the climate data, monthly predictions for 2076 to 2080 are being compared between two different emissions scenarios: rcp4.5 and rcp8.5. To look at all three data together, it is assumed that soil pH and aspect will be very similar, if not the same, between current day, 2024, and 2076-2080. So current day soil pH and aspect will be used.
